World Wide Experimental Design (WoWED) for volcano monitoring is a collection of Jupiter notebooks that provide a framework for the design of volcano monitoring networks. The notebooks and helper functions aim to allow fast and accuarate design of monitoring networks for volcanoes in an interactive way. A detailed description of the methods and the notebooks can be found in the following publication:

## Getting Started

The easiest way of getting started is through our colab notebooks:

| Example | Link |
| --- | --- |
| basic interactive notebook | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dominik-strutz/WoWED-volcano/blob/main/main_design_notebook.ipynb)    |


## Local Installation

To use the notebooks locally, you can clone the repository and install the required packages. The following commands will clone the repository and install the required packages:

### Using conda
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominik-strutz/WoWED-volcano
cd WoWED-volcano
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate WoWED-volcano
```

### Using pip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominik-strutz/WoWED-volcano
cd WoWED-volcano
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the required packages, you can start the Jupyter notebook server by running the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your browser where you can navigate to the notebooks and start using them.
